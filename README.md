### Abstract 

Current genetic discovery methods are largely restricted to profiling circulating molecules or genetic architecture, limited in use of tissue-based molecular genetics to identify pathogenic and therapeutic targets. Here, we leverage a multi-level genetic discovery platform integrating population-level proteomics with functional genomic analyses based on human coronary artery tissue to reveal determinants of coronary disease susceptibility. Using aptamer-based proteomics (≈7,000 aptamers) across ≈3,000 individuals, we first identified the circulating proteome of prevalent and incident coronary artery calcium (CAC)—a highly specific marker of subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD)—with causal implication in calcified plaque formation or disease phenotypes via parallel genetic approaches (Mendelian randomization, MR) and proteome-wide association (PWAS). Identified proteins specified pathways of extracellular matrix remodeling, immune cell function, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. To resolve findings at a coronary tissue level, we performed the largest to date coronary artery-specific transcriptome-wide association study for CAC (TWAS; based on RNA-seq from >250 human coronary arteries) in >35,000 individuals, demonstrating enrichment of targets from the circulating proteome with supportive evidence by traditional MR approaches (NOTCH3, SPINK2, S100A12, RPP25, OAF, HS6ST3, TNFSF12, GPC6), several implicated in CVD-adjacent biological mechanisms. Phenome-wide association and single cell transcriptomics in human coronary arteries across atherosclerosis implicated targets in tissue-specific disease mechanisms. Finally, using coronary artery-specific functional genomic annotations of chromatin structure, conformation, and accessibility, we identified trans regulation of two of these genes (GPC6, RPP25) by CAC GWAS-significant SNPs, resolving targets for previously “orphan” genome-wide significant loci. These multi-level findings furnish a resource for pathobiology of CAC, atherosclerosis, and establish an adaptable framework applicable to all organ systems to parse precision targets for prevention, surveillance, and therapy of cardiovascular disease.
